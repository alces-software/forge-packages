# intro(7) -- Introduction to your cluster

Welcome to your cluster, a high performance computing (HPC) system
that provides an environment to support your work in scientific
computing, simulation, engineering and research and development.

This system is configured with Alces Clusterware: an open-source HPC
environment, from the team behind Alces Flight, that focuses on user
convenience and takes the complexity out of working with HPC clusters.

## TOOLS

Alces Clusterware is shipped with a number of tools that reduce the
complexity of working with HPC environments:

  * Help and support:

    The `alces about` tool (this one!) provides information about how
    to get the most out of your Alces Flight environment.  For further
    support, visit the Alces Flight Community site at
    <https://community.alces-flight.com> where you can discuss your
    questions and HPC requirements with the community.

    For "how-to" guides on multiple subjects, try the `alces howto`
    tool.

  * Job script templates:

    Create job scripts for your HPC tasks using the `alces template`
    tool, which provides access to multiple job script templates
    tailored for this particular HPC system.

  * Software and configuration:

    Install and manage self-service software with the `alces gridware`
    tool, which provides access to a curated set of HPC applications
    built and tested by the Alces Flight crew.

    Add additional capabilities to your Alces Clusterware environment,
    manage data sets, scripts and your custom software builds using
    the `alces forge` tool.

  * Data storage and management:

    Use the `alces storage` tool to configure simple access to public
    and private object storage, such as Amazon S3 and Dropbox and to
    manage access to local data repositories.

  * Interactive GUI sessions:

    When you need to deal with GUI applications, use the `alces
    session` tool to create desktop sessions you can connect to using
    a VNC desktop client from your workstation, allowing you to run
    your graphical tools for workload setup, execution and data
    visualizations.

## SOFTWARE

Additional software, suited to the kind of HPC problems you want to
solve, can be obtained via self-service using the Alces Gridware tool.
Complete with a curated set of software packages provided by Alces
Flight, the `alces gridware` tool gives you the capability to build
from source code or install from a set of preprepared binary builds.

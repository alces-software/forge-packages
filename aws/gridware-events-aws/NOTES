Flows:

1. Master serves Gridware initialized in image (local disk) over NFS to slaves
2. Master serves Gridware initialized on instance (persistent disk) over NFS to slaves
3. Gridware is served from elsewhere (network disk) over NFS to master and slaves


1. cluster-gridware handler with "immediate" configuration
- when slave joins, can create/enable immediately

2. cluster-gridware handler with "event" configuration
- when slave joins, can create/enable only if gridware is ready

3. no cluster-gridware handler


Events:

1. storage-ready
2. depots-available
3. nfs-ready

storage-ready
- disk ready for population
- initialize gridware, inc. downloading depots
- trigger depots-available
- trigger nfs exports from master (trigger nfs mounts on slave)

depot enabled
- trigger `depot-enabled` event on slaves

depot disabled
- trigger `depot-disabled` event on slaves

depot added
- trigger `depot-added` event on slaves

member join
- if gridware is ready, trigger `depot-added` for all existing depots
